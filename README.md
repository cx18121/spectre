# Shadow Fight Real-Time

A 1v1 fighting game where two players throw real punches and kicks at their phone cameras and watch their silhouettes fight in a shared browser overlay. Built for the Cornell Claude Claude Builders Club Hackathon, spring 2026.

Each phone runs MediaPipe pose estimation in the browser and streams keypoints to a Python game server. The server runs hit detection, damage, and round logic. A separate browser overlay renders the match in a Shadow Fight 2 style, with a live AI commentator powered by the Claude API and ElevenLabs.

No accounts. No cloud. One player runs the server on their laptop, and Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale makes it reachable from anywhere.

## How it works

```
Phone A (mobile client)          Phone B (mobile client)
  camera + MediaPipe                camera + MediaPipe
        \                                  /
         \________ pose keypoints ________/
                          |

                    sparks, subtitles, TTS
```

## Setup

You need Python 3.11+, Node 20+, and `cloudflared` if you want internet play.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cx18121/claude-hackathon26.git
cd claude-hackathon26

# Server
cd server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Mobile client
cd mobile && npm install && cd ..

# Overlay
cd overlay && npm install && cd ..
```

Install `cloudflared` if you want to play across the internet:
- macOS: `brew install cloudflared`
- Linux: `apt install cloudflared`
- Windows: `winget install cloudflared`

For the AI commentator, drop your keys into `server/.env`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
```

Both keys are optional. Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` the commentator is disabled. Without `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` you get text subtitles but no audio.

## Running it

### Same WiFi (laptop + two phones in one room)

```bash
bash scripts/dev.sh
```

This builds both Vite bundles, frees ports 8000/5173/5174, and starts everything. The server prints a room code on startup. Phones reach the server at the LAN IP printed in the launcher banner.

URLs the script prints:

```
Overlay:        http://<LAN_IP>:8000/overlay?room=<CODE>
Player 1 phone: http://<LAN_IP>:8000/mobile?room=<CODE>&slot=1
Player 2 phone: http://<LAN_IP>:8000/mobile?room=<CODE>&slot=2
```

### Across the internet (Cloudflare Tunnel)

```bash
cd server
source .venv/bin/activate
TUNNEL=true python main.py
```

The server prints a `trycloudflare.com` URL and a QR code. Share the URL with the other player. Both phones open `<url>/mobile?slot=1` and `?slot=2`. Open the overlay at `<url>/overlay`.

### Across blocked networks (Tailscale)

If you are on eduroam, hotel WiFi, or anywhere that blocks LAN discovery, use Tailscale instead. Every machine needs Tailscale installed and signed in to the same tailnet.

```bash
bash scripts/tailscale.sh
```

The script auto-detects your Tailscale IP, sets up `tailscale serve` for HTTPS (so phone browsers stop blocking the camera), and prints share-ready URLs.

## Playing a match

1. Both players open the camera capture URL on their phones/laptops with different slot numbers.
2. The host opens the overlay on a laptop or TV browser.
3. Each player completes a short calibration: 3 practice jabs and a neutral stance.
4. The match starts once both players finish calibrating and are ready.

Stand sideways to your phone. MediaPipe needs a side-view angle to read depth correctly.

## Notes and known limits

- The simulation uses delay-based netcode. The server measures RTT to both players every 500ms and applies the larger value as a uniform input delay so neither player has a frame advantage. Above 150ms RTT the clients show a lag warning.
- MediaPipe gives 3D world landmarks in meters relative to the hip. The server uses z for depth checks during hit detection. The overlay only uses x and y.
- Pose frames stream at 30fps. The server simulates at 60Hz, interpolating between the two most recent pose frames.
- iOS Safari requires HTTPS for camera access. Cloudflare Tunnel and `tailscale serve` both provide this. On plain LAN, use the Chrome insecure-origin flag described in the Tailscale script output.
