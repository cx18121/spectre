/**
 * guardDetection.ts — guard pose detection with hysteresis for FPS boxing.
 *
 * Guard pose: player raises both wrists above both shoulders.
 *
 * Y-axis sign note (from Plan 14-01b Task 2 spike A):
 *   MediaPipe worldLandmarks Y is positive-down (hip-midpoint origin).
 *   Shoulder is above hip → shoulder.y is negative (e.g. -0.3).
 *   Raised wrist (above shoulder) → wrist.y is even more negative (e.g. -0.5).
 *   Guard condition: shoulder.y - wrist.y > threshold
 *     e.g. (-0.3) - (-0.5) = 0.2 > 0.05 → guard active.
 *   Raw MediaPipe keypoints are used here (not world-space), so this comparison
 *   operates directly on PoseKeypoint.y without the negation from keypointToWorld.
