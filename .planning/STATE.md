# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-01)

**Core value:** The engine must make it trivially easy to add a new pose-based game by implementing a well-defined plugin interface — without touching the engine core or understanding its internals.
**Current focus:** Phase --phase — 03

## Current Position

Phase: --phase (03) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of --name
Status: Executing Phase --phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Rust full-server rewrite (Axum + Tokio); no Python in server path
- Init: Wire protocol unchanged — TypeScript clients are not modified
- Init: Game plugin as Rust trait (not WASM/scripting); all plugin methods synchronous
- Init: Boxing is first plugin; second game validates that the abstraction generalizes

### Pending Todos
