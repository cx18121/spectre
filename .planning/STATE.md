## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Rust full-server rewrite (Axum + Tokio); no Python in server path
- Init: Wire protocol unchanged — TypeScript clients are not modified
- Init: Game plugin as Rust trait (not WASM/scripting); all plugin methods synchronous
- Init: Boxing is first plugin; second game validates that the abstraction generalizes

### Pending Todos
